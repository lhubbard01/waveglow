If the open function doesnt work on your comp, go to the forked waveglow page on my github.
  there, both the mel spectrogram and the model will be available for download in nividas readme. 
Those should be placed in this directory at this level. 

make sure you download all of the packages in the virtual environment through the conda install interface... 
that should be taken care of by the python function i wrote.
  All you have to do once conda is installed is run "source activate waveglow" and then run the python file.
  after this is done, I would try copy and pasting the command associated with the pretrained version from my forked nvidia waveglow page.
